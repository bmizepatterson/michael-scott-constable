## Installation instructions

To install dependencies, open your terminal to the project root and run `npm install`.

## To combile sass

Open your terminal to the project root and run this command:

`./node_modules/.bin/sass --watch assets/main.scss assets/main.css`

This will set up sass to watch the assets/main.scss file for changes. Sass produces/updates two files:

1. assets/main.css (This is the css file used by the site.)
2. assets/main.css.map
